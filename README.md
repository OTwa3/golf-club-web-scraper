This is a custom webscraper that specifically targets Canadian used golf club websites. It can be used to compare prices for used and new clubs quickly by setting a few filters. The data can be filtered according to club type, brand, as well as hand dexterity.
As of right now, it scrapes 4 websites: Just Golf Stuff, Global Golf, Golf Avenue, as well as local listings in facebook marketplace.
I plan to expand functionality to as many North American used club websites as I can in the near future.
