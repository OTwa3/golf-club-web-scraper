This is a custom webscraper that specifically targets Canadian used golf club websites. 
As of right now, it scrapes 4 websites: Just Golf Stuff, Global Golf, Golf Avenue, as well as local listings in facebook marketplace.

Once the data is collected, it is stored in a sqllite3 database, which can then be queried with the original listing link and price.
